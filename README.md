# SpaceInvader

Space Invader is a classic game, where you are competing against aliens in space in order to save your planet. It has a fixed shooter  which the player controls a laser cannon which moves horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen.
